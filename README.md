Trying out the latest [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13)
Just wanted to get a hands-on experience with the latest Next.js 13 with the newly introduced `app` directory.
This is a simple dashboard application and it uses

- <a rel="me" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>
- <a rel="me" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>
- <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@s0lution">daisyUI</a>


## Get Started

Install the dependencies with 
```bash
yarn install
```
and run the application with

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
